# Introduction
JetCobot is a 7-axis visual collaborative robotic arm. It uses the NVIDIA series development board as the main control board. It adopts a configuration similar to the UR robot, flexible movement, and maximum effective arm span of 270MM. Through the ROS robot operating system and inverse kinematics algorithm, the robotic arm coordinate control, motion planning, gripping and sorting functions are realized. It equipped it with a 0.3MP USB camera, combined with OpenCV images, machine vision, deep learning and other algorithms, can complete color interaction, face tracking, label recognition, model training, gesture interaction and other functions. In addition to supporting MoveIt simulation control, JetCobot also supports APP, handle, PC web control.

High-precision control and flexible movement: JetCobot adopts a 7-axis design, has a configuration similar to the UR robot, and with the inverse kinematics algorithm, it ensures flexible and precise motion control. The maximum effective arm span is 270MM, the joint rotation range is -153°~153°, and it can handle a variety of complex operation tasks.

Camera and robotic arm 2 in 1: Equipped with a 0.3MP USB camera with a 110° field of view. Combining OpenCV image processing, machine vision and deep learning algorithms, JetCobot can realize functions such as color interaction, face tracking, tag recognition, model training and gesture interaction.

Based on NVIDIA series development boards: With NVIDIA series development boards as the main control, JetCobot has powerful computing power and AI processing capabilities, which can efficiently process complex vision and control algorithms to ensure real-time response and efficient execution.

Support multiple control methods: Based on the ROS robot operating system, JetCobot can realize MoveIt simulation control, and also supports APP control(Just for Android), handle control and PC web control to meet the needs of different users.
